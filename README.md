# Zoo-Encyclopedie

🦁 Project: The Creche Zoo Learning Encyclopedie
This document provides an overview of the Zoo project, a simple and interactive web application designed to help young children at a crèche memorize and learn about animals in a fun, game-like environment.

🎯 Project Goal
        The primary goal is to create an engaging web platform that tests toddlers' knowledge about the Zoo, covering animals, their habitats, food types, and corresponding images. This aims to make learning about the animal kingdom an enjoyable experience.

🛠️ Back-End Development (PHP)
        As the Back-End Developer, my focus is on building a robust and dynamic server-side application using PHP.

        Core Features
        CRUD Operations for Animals: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for managing animal records. This includes handling and displaying animal images.

        Dynamic Data Display: Establish a connection to the database to dynamically fetch and display animal information and their associated images on the website.

        Separate Habitat Management: A separate, dedicated structure (modeled as a "table séparée" in the context) will be used to manage and categorize animal habitats.

Enhanced Features:
        🔍 Search and Filtering: Implement filters to allow educators and older children to easily search for animals by habitat or food type. This enhances navigation and discoverability.

📊 Data Visualization (Statistics):
        Integrate charts and graphs to visually present animal statistics (e.g., number of animals per habitat, food type distribution). This makes the data easily understandable for users.

🌐 Internationalization:
        Implement a language switching feature to allow users to view the content in both French and English.

🚀 Getting Started:
    To run this project, you will need:
        Web Server: Apache.
        PHP.
        Database: MySQL.
